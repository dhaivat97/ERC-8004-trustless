# EIP-8004 Smart Contract (Testnet)

This repository contains a Solidity implementation aligned with EIP-8004, deployed and tested on a public testnet.

The contract focuses on:
- Standards-compliant architecture
- Clear access control patterns
- Upgrade-safe and maintainable design
- Production-oriented Solidity practices

## Overview
While this contract is not an NFT implementation, it demonstrates the same design discipline, security considerations, and development workflow that I apply to production NFT and dApp smart contracts.

## Deployment
- Network: Testnet
- Explorer: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f6e834b22C8913A4AbC396264BC6082817a4DFf

## Tech Stack
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- TypeScript

## Notes
This repository is shared for review purposes and reflects real-world development practices rather than a minimal example.
